# efficent-market-hypothesis-project
I estimate whether one can 'beat the market' by analysing historic stock data.

This project analyses the returns of IBM against the Dow Jones Industry Average Index between October 2023 and 2024. The results validate the Efficient Market Hypothesis ; IBM returns are essentially unpredictable using historical data, as evident by the lagged excess return coefficent being statistically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, one cannot expect to gain greater returns than the market, at least not with IBM.
